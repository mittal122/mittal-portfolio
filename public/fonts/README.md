# Font Files

## Manist by Redy Studio

Place your Manist font files here with the following names:

- `Manist-Regular.woff2`
- `Manist-Regular.woff`
- `Manist-Bold.woff2`
- `Manist-Bold.woff`
- `Manist-Black.woff2`
- `Manist-Black.woff`

## How to obtain the font:

1. Purchase Manist font from Redy Studio or an authorized font distributor
2. Convert the font files to .woff2 and .woff formats if needed
3. Place them in this directory

## Important:
The font is currently configured in `src/index.css` and will fall back to 'Space Grotesk' if the Manist font files are not found.
